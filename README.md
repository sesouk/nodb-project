# Preme Comics
Preme Comics is an individually built website developed to help keep track of comic books owned.
## Why?
Developing a website such as Preme Comics is the first step into developing much bigger projects and a lot of the concepts and technologies used can be carried over to other web-apps. 
## How?
This was my first full-stack web-app without a database and several technologies went into creating this such as: React | JavaScript(ES6) | CSS | Node | Express | Massive | Axios.
